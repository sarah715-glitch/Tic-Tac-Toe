# Overview

This program is designed to help my understand and knowledge grow with the Python language. Although I have worked with Python before, I wanted to do some more research and be able to create a mini game. I have chosen tic-tac-toe because I felt that it would be simple enough to create within a short time and this game would also allow me to use different tools such as variables, classes, conditional statements, etc. This game allows the user to play a tic-tac-toe game, with the outcome ready for any possibilites that can occur, letting the user play again if desired.

# Development Environment

I used classes, conditional statements, loops, data structures, and variables to develop my program. I also wrote this code in Python to develop my skills more in the programming language.
